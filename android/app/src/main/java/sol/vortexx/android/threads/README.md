# `sol/vortexx/android/threads/` — `threads` feature

Android feature package for **threads**. Internal layout:

- `api/` — Kotlin interfaces with no Android deps (easy to JVM-test).
- `impl/` — concrete types wired to Ktor / Room / Compose / Hilt.
- `di/`  — Hilt `@Module` bindings linking interfaces to impls.

Mirrors the iOS module of the same name under `../../../../../../../ios/Modules/Sources/Threads/`.
